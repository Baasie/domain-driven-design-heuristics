> We all use heuristics (even if we haven’t articulated them to others) to discover, understand, explore, create, modify, or extend complex software systems. Billy Vaughn Koen, in Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer’s Approach to Problem Solving, defines a heuristic as, “anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

Domain-Driven Design Heuristics is a community driven site to document and discuss about Design Heuristics. For now we divide into three different types of heuristics:

* [Design Heuristics](/design-heuristics): Heuristics we use to solve a specific problem;
* [Guiding Heuristics](/guiding-heuristics): Heuristics that guide our use of other heuristics (meta-heuristics, if you will);
* [Value-based Heuristics](value-based-heuristics): Heuristics that determine our attitude and behavior towards design or the world and the way we work;

Checkout the [Heuristics](/heuristics) tab.

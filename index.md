> We all use heuristics (even if we haven’t articulated them to others) to discover, understand, explore, create, modify, or extend complex software systems. Billy Vaughn Koen, in Discussion of the Method: Conducting the Engineer’s Approach to Problem Solving, defines a heuristic as, “anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

Domain-Driven Design Heuristics is a community driven site to document and discuss about Design Heuristics. For now we divide into two different heuristics:

* [Guiding Heuristics](/guiding-heuristics): heuristics to guide our use of other heuristics.
* [Design Heuristics](/design-heuristics): heuristics to solve a particular problem at hand.

If you want to submit your own heuristics go to [Submit Heuristics](/submit) for explanations.

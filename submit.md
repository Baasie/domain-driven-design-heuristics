This sites works with jekyll on a github repo netlify. You can fork the github repo [here](https://github.com/Baasie/domain-driven-design-heuristics) and create a pull request of your own heuristics.

You can a add your own heuristics as a markdown file under the respective _XXXX-heuristics directory. 

Now we know not everyone used github so alterntivly you can send your heuristic in an email to submit@dddheuristic.com.

Use the following template when filling in your heuristic:

## Template

``` markdown
---
title: {The title of the heuristic}
excerpt: {The question that the heuristic solves}
tags: {What you think it best to use}
authors: {the authors}
submitter: {The submitter} (optional)

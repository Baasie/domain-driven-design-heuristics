# Description

We live in a Deep Democractic world, where nothing has meaning of itself. When we design collaborativly we all have our own model of the world. We want to use all these different angles and perceptions of people when mdesigning to get the best possible model. That is why our attitude toward each other shuld be that everyone is right, and no one has the monopoly to the truth. Using that behaviour will get us in a state of curiousity towards others perception, and we will continuously learn from each other.

# Short description

Different people are a great indicator of different needs, which means different models. Design a bounded context around the needs of different people. 

# Context

Where people are during the exploration of a big picture eventstorming, is probably giving the simplest and powerful clue about different model
distribution. Experts tend to spend most time hovering around the areas that they know better, to provide answers
or to correct wrong stickies¹⁵ that they see on the paper roll. Alternatively, they comment around
the areas that they care about, maybe because the current implementation is far from satisfactory.

# Short description

align boundaries with data which must always be immediately consistent.

# Examples

When a user reserve specific seats for a cinema those seats needs to stay reserved and unavailable for other users for a certain amount of time while the user pays.

# Context

We should align boundaries in sociotechnical systems with our business processes to minimise dependencies and promote sustainable development practices.

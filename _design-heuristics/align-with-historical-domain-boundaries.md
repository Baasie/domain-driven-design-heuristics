# Short description

Look for parts of the domain which have not changed in a long time.

# Examples

A user inbox for keeping communication message to the customer, this almost never changes.

# Context

We should align boundaries in sociotechnical systems with our business processes to minimise dependencies and promote sustainable development practices.

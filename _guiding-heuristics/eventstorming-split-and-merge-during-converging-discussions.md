# Short description

When there are competing ideas during an eventstorming, we want to visualise both ideas. Split both discussion, discuss and then merge.

# Examples

1. When we are in the converging phase of eventstorming, we already moved a lot of ideas. Sometimes new ideas pop up.
2. When we are the chaotic exploration phase then we can just add the missing domain events.

# Context

Especially during a software design eventstorming, different ideas can pop up when we already started to use the colour coding. So people have the feeling that they want to leave there current ideas intact and not touch it. So then conversation start to move to invisible things.

# Short description

During a EventStorming we want to add more detail when the conversation is not visualised. If during a conversation the body language is turned towards the group instead of towards the the paper roll, then we need to add more details.

# Examples

1. When someone is telling a story and is pointing towards stickies on the paper roll, we will have enough details.
2. When there is a discussion that is turned towards the group instead of pointing towards stickies on the paper roll, we need to add in more details

# Context

During an EventStorming session on any level, we want to make our conversations visible on the paper roll with stickies. During the whole durtion of the EventStorming we need to have enough detail so that there is a common understanding.

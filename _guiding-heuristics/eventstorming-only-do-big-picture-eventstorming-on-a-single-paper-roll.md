# Description

For a Big Picture EventStorming let all the participants share their domain events on the same paper roll.

# Summary of the solution

With a Big Picture EventStorming we want all participants to share their domain events on the same paper roll. We can have 20-30+ people as long as there is enough [facilitators](eventstorming-one-facilitator-for-every-15-participants.md). Which is different from a process or design level EventStroming where we can [split and merge](eventstorming-split-and-merge-above-7-people.md).

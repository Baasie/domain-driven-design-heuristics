# Short description

When working in a greenfield problem space, start by exploring with to-be process modelling.

# Summary of the solution

When we start to explore the problem space with eventstorming in a green field there is no current process to explore. In this case we want to do eventstorming for the to-be situation. However we don't want to jump into design, so we do a process eventstorming on the to-be situation.

# Short description

When Example Mapping a story we want to timebox our Example Mapping for it to 20 minutes. After we want to either split the story or answer the questions before pulling it out again.

# Context

When doing Behaviour-Driven Development we want to discover more knowledge and we can do that by using Example Mapping. During example mapping we start writing our examples for a specific business rule.

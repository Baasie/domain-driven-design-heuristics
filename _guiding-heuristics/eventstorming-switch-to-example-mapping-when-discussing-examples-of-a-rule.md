# Description

During Process or Design level EventStorming we can get stuck in talking about invisible things for business constraint/rule like the purple or yellow sticky. It happens that we get into the use cases or examples discussion, it is here were we switch to Example Mapping.

# Examples

* Talking about consistent business constraints/rules (the yellow sticky)
* Talking about translations use cases for a policy.

# Summary of the solution

EventStorming is really effective for telling stories in a timeline. It can be less effective when we start discussing use cases or examples that can all happen at one point in time. What can happen is that people move the discussion from the paper roll and stickies towards each other. Now we are discussing invisible things.

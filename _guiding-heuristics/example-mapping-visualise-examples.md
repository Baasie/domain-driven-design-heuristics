# Short description

When possible, make a visualisation explaining your concrete scenario for a business rule.

# Context

When doing Behaviour-Driven Development we want to discover more knowledge and we can do that by using Example Mapping. During example mapping we start writing our examples for a specific business rule. When we for instance create scenario's for a theather or cinema allocation system, make a visualisation of the seating arrangement for the example that relate to allocating seats.

# Description

For a Big Picture EventStorming let all the participants share their domain events on a single paper roll.

# Summary of the solution

With a Big Picture EventStorming we want all participants to share their domain events on a single same paper roll. Usually we have around 20-30+ people as long as their is enough facilitators. Which is different from a process or design level EventStroming where we split and merge above 7 people.

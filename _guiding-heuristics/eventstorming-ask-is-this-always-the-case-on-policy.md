# Description

If we visualise a policy (Lilac sticky) during an EventStorming based on 'whenever this Domain Event happens we will do this action/command', always ask the question: Is this what we always do?

We can make a lot of assumptions during an EventStorming on process or design level. Policies, asl Alberto says, are great lie detectors. We can aks a lot of questions about them and there is almost always more to discover.

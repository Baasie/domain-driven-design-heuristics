# Question

When shall I use process modelling eventstorming for as-is discovery of my problem space.

# Short description

When we start to explore the problem space in brown field we want to first know the current state the process and the software it uses now, 
before we can start changing the process and the software.

# Examples

Exploring a problem in a problem space that already has processes and systems in place.

# Context

When we explore a problem space that already has processes and software systems like almost all enterprises.

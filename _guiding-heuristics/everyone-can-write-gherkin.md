# Short description

Everyone should formalise examples when using the Gherkin language. Then you share it back with the team before you pull the story in the sprint as a last check that everyone is aligned

# Context

When doing Behaviour-Driven Development we want to formalise our examples so we can possibly use these to automate them.

# Description

Brain science shows us that movement trumps sitting. Meaning with remote EventStorming we ask the participants to do some movement during breaks.

# Summary of the solution

Sitting for extended lengths of time makes thinking and learning more difficult to do because the oxygen levels in the body decrease. Remote EventStorming is different from EventStorming because offline we keep moving.

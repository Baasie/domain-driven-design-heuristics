# Short description

Stories, requests beginning with "to do" must be reformulated so that they describe the benefits and the users of those benefits. 
Otherwise they move the focus from the "why" to the "how" and drives the discussion to the technical implementation instead of the domain behaviour.
# Context

Implementing DDD needs a shared knowledge about the domain and the common effort to dive deeper and deeper when this understanding grows. This means, the team should focus on the domain and not on the technical details.

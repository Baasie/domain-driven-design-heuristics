# Description

When working in a brownfield problem space, harvest current knowledge by exploring with as-is process modelling.

#  Summary of the solution

When we start to explore the problem space in brown field we want to first know the current state the process and the software it uses now, before we can start changing the process and the software. Because a rewrite is dangerous for making the same mistakes, we will decouple and the current system and for that we need to harvest current knowledge.

# Short description

A lot times during example mapping assumptions and questions pop up which get written on a red sticky. Use the red sticky also to put down any future wishes the business might have. It can be helpfull when designing your model and choosing the one that can accomodate to that future wish. We don't want to accomodate for it now however.

# Context

When doing Behaviour-Driven Development we want to discover more knowledge and we can do that by using Example Mapping. During example mapping we start writing our examples for a specific business rule.

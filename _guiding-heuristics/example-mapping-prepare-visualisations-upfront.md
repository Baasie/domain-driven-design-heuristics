# Short description

When story will get complex visualisation, we are more busy with finding the right visualisation for them. Prepare these visualisations up front so that the conversation will be about the examples rather on how to visualise.

# Context

When doing Behaviour-Driven Development we want to discover more knowledge and we can do that by using Example Mapping. During example mapping we start writing our examples for a specific business rule. We want to visualise these examples especially complex ones.

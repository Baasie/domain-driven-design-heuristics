# Short description

Someone may have had a bad night of sleep, a sick child at home or a a wisdom tooth that is acting up. This will affect your behavior during a workshop and if you don't have an opportunity to explain to others how you 'feel' beforehand, you may be perceived as uninterested or otherwise obstructing the progress. 

Check-ins allow everyone to 'touch ground' on how they are doing and to share anything that might be relevant in the context of the session with the group. Typically this is also an opportunity to share your expectations of the session itself. Check-ins are done monologue- and popcorn-style. The facilitator writes 2-3 questions on a whiteboard and everyone in the group can choose to speak when they feel comfortable.


# Examples

1. Do this when you're facilitating a workshop and you want everyone to be fully (mentally) present and open up.
2. You can also use this if you have a regular recurring (i.e. weekly) meeting.
   

# Context

Done before a workshop starts and after a workshop ends (check-out).

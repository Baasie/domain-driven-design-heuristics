# Description

Keep EventStorming sessions which are remote up to a maximum of two hours for a day

# Summary of the solution

Sitting for extended lengths of time makes thinking and learning more difficult to do because the oxygen levels in the body decrease. During an offline EventStorming, we always tell the importance of oxygen. Doing remote work, we often lack that fresh air, we donâ€™t move enough, and that resolves that we cannot stay focused for an extended period, even with short movement breaks in between.

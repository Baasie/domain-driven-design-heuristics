# Short description

For a Big Picture EventStorming, we can have around 20-30+ people per wall - but even an experienced facilitator will have a hard time noticing subtleties, body language and tonal nuances when more than 2-3 conversations are going on at the same time. Limit the group size per facilitator to ~15. For larger groups, it is advisable to add co-facilitators to help with the things happening behind your back. 

# Examples

1. Doing a Big Picture EventStorming.
2. A co-facilitator should be present for every group of 15 participants.
3. The workshop agenda and general workings should be guided by the main facilitator.

# Context

# Short description

A popular phrase in EventStorming is: You can see by the amount of stickies removed and crumbled on the grond how effective the EventStorming is. However sometimes a group is not removing stickies themselve. As a facilitator you want to lead by example and start removing stickies that can be removed.

# Examples

1. When stickies are on top of each other and seems similar, ask the group which one they want to keep then throw the rest away.
2. When you notice the group cannot make a decision, or someone is not heard you got to dive into the why of the stickies first.
3. Sometimes stickies are not similar but sound similar. So make sure they are really the same!

# Context

During an EventStorming at any time from enforcing the timeline you can see ducplicated stickies.

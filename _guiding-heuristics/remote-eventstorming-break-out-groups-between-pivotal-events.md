# Description

If we get more than 10 people during enforcing the timeline with a remote big picture eventstorming, the effectiveness and amount of insights goes down. The sweetspot here seem to be around 4-8 people in one virtual meeting room doing an enforcing the timeline. This poses a challange, as we want to model the entire business domain on one board with big picture eventstorming. During a physical events, people will usually split into several boards, cleaning it up. But how do we split up during a remote session, were people cannot just walk around?

# Summary of the solution

Decide together on pivotal events, or emerging pivotal events. Let the group move their own stickies in between these pivotal events. Now create break-out groups and split the group up between the pivotal events. Let people at the start self-organise, but be carefull that some break-out groups do not fill up. Iterate back to the main room every 15-20 minutes for a recap and realignment. Eventually always finish with a walktrough narrative.

# Short description

When people are new to EventStorming, their initial approach is often to be reluctant to write things that aren't 100% correct. By making an example of the first sticky you throw away as a facilitator, you allow everyone to try something, be wrong, and improve over time. Doing so helps set the stage for iterative learning.

# Examples

1. Doing a Big Picture EventStorming.
2. Put a paper basket in the middle of the wall, so that it is easily accessible and very prominent.

# Context

Opening up a Big Picture EventStorming session

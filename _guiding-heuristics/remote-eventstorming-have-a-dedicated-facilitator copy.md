# Description

Start enforcing a single flow EventStorm, have only one person able to edit post-its and have the rest navigate that person. 


# Summary of the solution

During our remote EventStorming on the virtual Domain-driven design meetup, we observed that while enforcing the timeline engagement was low. During offline EventStorming it can happen as well, but an excellent facilitator will start asking questions. The problem is, using tools like miro you cannot see where people are working on, so it is hard to know what is going on.

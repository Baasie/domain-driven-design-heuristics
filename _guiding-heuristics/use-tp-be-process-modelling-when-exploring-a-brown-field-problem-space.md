# Short description

When we start to explore the problem space with eventstorming in a green field there is no current process to explore. In this case we want to do eventstorming for the to-be situation

# Examples

Exploring the problem space that has no process and systems.

# Context

When we explore a problem space that already has processes and software systems like almost all enterprises.

# Short description

When wrapping up a big picture EventStorming there will be a dot voting on hotspots or opportunities. The outcome of the vote means that the group finds that vote the biggest constraint (Theory of constraint) of the domain. The next day we want to start working and tackling this part of the domain to create the most value of time spend. Before we wrap up we want to ask the people who did not vote for that hotspot or opportunity 'what they need to also commit to that decision'. We add these needs to the decision so that we made a collective authocratic decision, were everyone feels included. 

# Examples

1. Do when there is a minority who did not vote on the majority decision made.
2. When there is a majority in the group we don't need it, however it seldom happens and perhaps there is not enough safety to speak up.

# Context

During a big picture EventStorming we always decide on a group what our biggest theory of constraint is. However the minority of people who did not decide for the winning decision might feel left out. They also might have wisdom we missed during our EventStorming session. So what can we learn from the people who did not vote on that decision, and how can we get buy-in from this group so that they won't resist when moving forward on it. What are there needs?

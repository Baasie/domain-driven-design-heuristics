# Short description

Just before dot voting for the theory of constraint in a big picture EventStorming, we want to let everyone speak up there mind. Do this with a two minutes elevator pitch were people in a monologue can pitch there biggest constraints or opportunities on the board.

# Examples

1. Always do it before a dotvote in big picture EventStorming
2. When you notice there is more focus on specific hotspots or opportunities, we might want to use Deep Democracy instead of the pitch and dot voting.

# Context

During a big picture EventStorming we want to know what the groups feels the theory of constraint is. We want to make sure everything that needs to be said has been said.

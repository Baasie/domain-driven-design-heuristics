# Description

Let the domain expert tell the story and the rest of the group write down the domain events. 

# Summary of the solution

When using EventStorming it can be that only one person has the domain knowledge, for instance when building a new product and there is no current process. Here chaotic exploration won't work. We want to let the other people maximise their knowledge gain by being active, and they can challange their own assumptions of that knowledge.

# Description

When we enforce the timeline we want to have a dedicated person (the driver) moving stickies on the board and make sure that information sticks. Sharon Bowman can help us here in these following trumps:

* Shorter trumps longer
* Different trumps same.
* Talking trumps listening

So switch the driver every 5 min naturally to the next person, so that each person will experience these trumps.

# Summary of the solution

EventStorming facilitates in creating a pool of shared meaning by creating conversation about each other perception. Physicly the moment people interact on a board it comes natural, however in a remote setting we need to change the way we do that.

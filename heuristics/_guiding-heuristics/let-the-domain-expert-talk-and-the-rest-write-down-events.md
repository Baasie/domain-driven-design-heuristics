# Question

If only the domain experts has the knowledge, how can we transfer that knowledge the most effectivly and also challenge their assumption of the knowledge?

# Short description

The domain expert will tell the story and the rest will write down the domain events. This way the other people maximise their knowledge gain by being active, and they can challange their own assumptions of that knowledge.

# Examples

When a new team is formed, and the only person having knowledge is the domain expert.

# Context

Building a new product, so there is no current process

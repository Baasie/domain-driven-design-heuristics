# Heuristics

> anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification, and potentially fallible.

Billy describes three different type of heuristics:

1. Heuristics we use to solve a specific problem;
2. Heuristics that guide our use of other heuristics (meta-heuristics, if you will);
3. Heuristics that determine our attitude and behavior towards design or the world and the way we work.

On this site you will find these three different heuristics as collections under:
* [Design](design-heuristics.md) 
* [Guiding](guiding-heuristics.md) 
* [Value-based heuristics](value-based-heuristics.md)
